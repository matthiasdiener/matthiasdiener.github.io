## Education

- **PhD in Computer Science**, October 2015.  
	*Berlin University of Technology (TU Berlin), Germany* and *Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil*.  
	Advisors: Prof. Hans-Ulrich Heiss and Prof. Philippe O. A. Navaux.  
	Dissertation: Automatic Task and Data Mapping in Shared Memory Architectures.  
	*Summa cum laude*.  
	Received award for 3rd best dissertation in Brazil in High Performance Computing, 2016.

- **Diploma (equivalent to M.Sc.) in Computer Engineering**, November 2010.  
	*Berlin University of Technology (TU Berlin), Germany*.  
	Advisor: Prof. Hans-Ulrich Heiss.


## Work Experience

- **Postdoctoral researcher in Computer Science**, January 2017 -- Present.  
	*University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign*.
    - *Memory affinity improvements in parallel systems:* Developed automatic mapping mechanisms to detect and optimize the memory access behavior of parallel applications, drastically improving performance and energy efficiency.
    - *Heterogeneous computing:* Designed a model for heterogeneous CPU+GPU computing with an adaptive load balancing scheme to distribute work.

- **Postdoctoral researcher in Computer Science**, November 2015 -- December 2016.  
	*Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil* and *University of Massachusetts, Amherst*.
    - *Performance portability of parallel applications in the cloud:* Developed scheduling improvements for large parallel applications running in public clouds, taking into account network and processing speeds as well as interference from other cloud tenants. Substantial improvements of execution time and performance portability in a variety of cloud computing environments.
    - *Memory tracing:* Created efficient memory tracing mechanisms that are faster than the current state-of-the-art and can trace physical memory addresses extracted from the host system in order to differentiate concurrently running applications.


## Teaching Experience

- **Lecturer/Technical Lead, Intel Modern Code Partner** (2016--2017).  
	*Intel* and *Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), Brazil*.
	-  Co-developed a series of short courses to teach undergraduate and early graduate students parallel and distributed processing for modern multicore and manycore systems, in a partnership project with Intel.
